# Plan your trip with Kayak

Kayak Marketing Team would like to create an application that will recommend where people should plan their next holidays. The application should be based on real data about:
- Weather
- Hotels in the area

The application should then be able to recommend the best destinations and hotels based on the above variables at any given time.

As for the scope of the project, we'll focus on the best cities to travel to in France according to [OneWeek.com](https://one-week-in.com/35-cities-to-visit-in-france/)
